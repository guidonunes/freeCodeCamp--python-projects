# Scientific Computing with Python (Beta)

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of Python projects and algorithms, developed as part of the Scientific Computing with Python certification program. The projects focus on applying Python to solve a variety of computational problems, with an emphasis on algorithms, data structures, and real-world applications.

The certification course covers Python fundamentals and progresses to advanced topics such as relational databases, data visualization, and algorithmic problem-solving.

## Projects

## 01. Caesar Cipher

* A simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a basic encryption algorithm that shifts letters in a string by a fixed number of positions.
* Latest Update: Fixed the print statements for output at the end of the code.

## 02. Luhn Algorithm

* A Python implementation of the Luhn algorithm, used to validate credit card numbers by performing checksum validation.
* Latest Update: Removed redundant print statement for the total value.

## 03. Expense Tracker

* A command-line application to track and manage personal expenses, including functionality to log and calculate totals.
* Latest Update: Called the main function at the end of the code to execute the program.

## 04. Case Converter

* A tool to convert text to different cases (e.g., snake case, camel case, etc.).
* Latest Update: Removed a redundant comment from the snake case conversion function.

## 05. Password Generator

* Generates random, secure passwords with customizable length and character sets.
* Latest Update: Added an if statement to handle password criteria validation.

## 06. Shortest Path Algorithm

* Implementation of an algorithm (such as Dijkstraâ€™s) to find the shortest path between two points in a graph.
* Latest Update: Passed a third argument to the function to handle specific graph scenarios.

## 07. Tower of Hanoi

* A recursive solution for the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, demonstrating the use of recursion to move disks between towers.
* Latest Update: Fixed indentation for proper code execution.

## 08. Merge Sort

* A Python implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm, which sorts a list using the divide-and-conquer approach.
* Latest Update: Added a print call to display sorted results.

## 09. Sudoku Solver

* A backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles, checking for valid placements of numbers in a grid.
* Latest Update: Added a test puzzle and called the solve_sudoku function to solve it.

## 10. Binary Search Tree

* A basic implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST), with functionality to insert, search, and delete nodes.
* Latest Update: Added a print call to verify the search of a deleted integer.

## 11. Arithmetic Formatter

* A Python script that formats basic arithmetic problems and outputs the result in a visually structured format.
* Latest Update: Added an if statement to check for operand length and ensure proper formatting.

## Learning Objectives

Throughout these projects, I learned and reinforced key programming concepts, including:

1. Python fundamentals (variables, loops, functions, etc.)
2. Data structures (lists, trees, graphs)
3. Algorithm development and analysis
4. Problem-solving techniques using recursion, sorting, and pathfinding
5. Relational databases and data visualization (to be covered in later stages)

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/guidonunes/scientific-computing-python.git
cd scientific-computing-python
```

Run the scripts: Each project has its own Python script. Navigate to the respective folder and execute the Python file:

```
python 01_cipher.py
```
